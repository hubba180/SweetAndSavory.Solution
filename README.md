## **üéÆUser Stories**

| Spec | Input | Output | Status |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | 
| There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on. |  |   | Green |
| A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it. |  |   |  |

## **üíªSETUP**

_NOTICE: The following instructions rely on the intended user to have mySQL Community server and Workbench installed in order to utilize SQL's local server. If mySQL is not installed, users may find a download for the SQL installer [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) to install the latest version of Community server and Workbench. Keep track of your local server's password, it will need to be appended to the appsettings.json after "pwd="_. 

copy this url to clone this project to your local system:

## **PROTECTING YOUR DATA**

#### **Step 1: From within VSCode in the root project directory, we will create a .gitignore file**

# For ![l-top](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/screenshots/v1.0.x/mac-pass-sm.png)
```js 
touch .gitignore 
```

# For ![l-top](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/screenshots/v1.0.x/windows-pass-sm.png)

```js 
ni .gitignore 
```

#### Step 2: commit that .gitignore file (this prevents your sensitive information from being shown to others). **‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU DO!‚ö†Ô∏è**

![setup](https://coding-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/entity-readme-image.png "Set up instructions")

#### Step 3: **To commit your .gitignore file enter the following commands**

```js
git add .gitignore
```
```js
git commit -m "protect data"
```

#### Step 4: **Then, you need to update your username and password in the appsettings.json file.**

_by default these are set to user:root and an empty password. if you are unsure, refer to the settings for your MySqlWorkbench._
